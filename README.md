#   Argon a Mintest lua executor

## Installation
- Clone the github repo
- Compile as X86 (32-Bit) Release
- (Or you can go to the releases and download the latest version!)
## Usage
1.Add `enable_console = true` to your minetest.conf located in minetest-5.3.0-win32

2.Open `ArgonExternalUI.exe` 
(***Make sure too have firacode.ttf in the same folder as the executable!***)

3.Click on `Inject` (Make sure too have Minetest open!) If all went well you should see a message box saying "Successfully Injected!" 

4.You can now execute lua scripts! **(All output is directed too Mintests console window!)**



## Known Bugs
- This currently does not support minetest multiplayer.
- If minetest crashes you have to close & reopen the ui for the inject button to work again.
